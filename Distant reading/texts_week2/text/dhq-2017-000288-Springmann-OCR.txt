1. Introduction
This paper describes a procedure for converting images of historical printings to
electronic text with high accuracies, ranging from 94% to 99% (character
accuracies) and 76% to 97% (word accuracies) on our test corpus, by applying
Neural Network-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The possibility to OCR
historical printings with the same relative ease as more recent printings from
the 20th century onward would be highly welcome to all researchers who have to
deal with source materials from these periods. By historical printings we mean
all documents from the beginning of modern printing in 1450 to the 19th
century.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for modern printed texts using the Latin
alphabet works very well and is often considered a solved problem (#doermann2014). Traditional OCR methods available in
commercial and open source software products work as follows: During the OCR
process, an image of a printed page is segmented into characters which are then
compared to abstract feature sets describing prototypical characters learned
previously from a set of trained fonts. The similarity of learned and recognized
fonts, the clear separation of uniformly black characters and white spotless
background, and modern standardized spelling of the printed words all contribute
to excellent recognition results.
This is, however, not true for early printings because of non-standard
typography, highly variable spelling preventing automatic lexical correction
during the OCR process, and physical degradation of the pages due to aging and
usage (see Figure 1 for two typical examples of pages from the RIDGES corpus, a
diachronic corpus of herbal texts in German, which will be described in more
detail in Section 3).
Historical typography alone poses a severe limit for the effectiveness of OCR:
All available OCR engines have been extensively trained on modern fonts, but
since historical fonts are very different from modern ones and the engines
cannot be trained very well by end users on these historical fonts, training on
modern fonts has very limited value for the OCR of historical printings. Even
for relatively late (i.e. 19th century) texts, OCR results (especially for the
multitude of highly variable broken blackletter typefaces) from
commercial OCR engines are often less than satisfactory (#piotrowski2012)
(#strange2014). Even the more regular Antiqua typefaces (Roman
glyph shapes) of historical printings often lead to character accuracies of only
around 85% when they are OCRed with ABBYY Finereader, a
leading commercial product (#reddy2006)
(#springmann2014). Tanner, Muñoz, and Ros (2009) report their
experience from the British Libary's 19th Century Online Newspaper Archive and state that character
accuracies greater than 95% are
more usual for post-1900 and pre-1950's text and
anything pre-1900 will be fortunate to exceed 85% accuracy.

Incunabula, as the earliest texts (printed from 1450 to 1500), have
been deemed to be completely unsuitable for OCR methods (#rydbergcox2009)
http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/1/000027/000027.html#p7.

Two page examples of early printings (left: Libavius 1603; right: Curioser
Botanicus, 1675) illustrating barriers to OCR: text mixed with images,
historical fonts, bleed-through from back page (left), bad contrast
(right).
The constraint that OCR engines only give good results on a fixed set of
pre-trained fonts can be lifted by the fully trainable open-source OCR engines
Tesseract and
OCRopus. There are two
ways of training, namely training on synthetic data (images generated from
existing electronic text and available computer fonts), or training on real data
(scans and their transcriptions). The first method obviates the need to generate
ground truth data by diplomatic transcriptions (a recording of
glyph shapes as they appear on a page, with no or minimal editorial
interpretation) which are needed to establish the link from glyph shapes to
characters during the training process, and one also does not need to preprocess
real images. As the complete training process can be automated, this training
method is the preferred one whenever it is applicable. However, the multitude of
historical fonts is not matched by existing computer fonts, and the
irregularities of word spacing in real printings lead to inferior recognition
results compared to training on real data (#springmann2014). OCR
training for historical printings therefore has to rely on a training process
using real data, which means that diplomatic transcriptions of printed images
become a key resource. Unfortunately, diplomatically transcribed historical
corpora which could serve as training data for historical fonts are not yet
available in sufficient quantity. One problem is variability. Earlier
typographies are more variable than modern ones because the process of
designing, producing and distributing metal letter types (type founding) had not
yet become a profession of its own, and early printers had to produce their own
typesets leading to a large variety of historical fonts. It is therefore
problematic to learn the associations between printed glyphs and the characters
they represent from one printing and apply them to the next.
The problem of applying OCR methods to historical printings is thus twofold.
First one needs to train an individual model for a specific book with its
specific typography. This can be achieved by transcribing some portion of the
printed text, which usually requires linguistic knowledge. Second, even if this
model works well for the book it has been trained on, it does not normally
produce good OCR results for other books, even if their fonts look similar to
the human eye. We need to overcome this typography barrier in order
to use OCR methods effectively in the building of a historical electronic text
corpus.
In the following we will describe our experiments addressing both problems.
First, we describe a procedure for training individual models,
using a new recognition algorithm based upon recurrent neural nets as
implemented in the open-source OCR engine OCRopus (#breuel2013).
As training material we use the readily available scans from library
digitization programs and the transcriptions from the RIDGES corpus. The
individual model is trained on a single document with its specific fonts and
word distances and therefore optimally adapted to this specific book. These
models yield the best recognition results for the unseen pages of the books for
which they have been trained, but unfortunately give mostly poor results on any
other books. Then we explore the viability of training mixed models
on a range of different typographies, pooling the training material from a
variety of books, with the hope that these models are able to better generalize
to other books that had no representation in the training pool. All models, even
the individual ones, only get tested on test sets that have no overlap with the
training material that was used in model training.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: The current state of the art
in historical OCR is related in Section 2. As we will illustrate and evaluate
our method on the RIDGES corpus we will briefly describe it in the Section 3.
Section 4 details our procedure for training individual models for a subset of
20 books printed in broken (blackletter) typefaces, which were used extensively
in German printing well into the 20th century. In Section 5 we present the
training results and discuss the need for building generalized (mixed) models.
Section 6 reports on our experiments to construct mixed models and their
performance on unseen books. In Section 7 we dicuss the significance of our
results for the building of historical corpora and Section 8 concludes with a
summary.
2. Related work
Work on historical OCR by other groups has mostly focused on Tesseract which is
trainable on artificial images generated from computer fonts. Training on real
data, however, has proven to be difficult, and lead to efforts to reconstruct
the original historical font from cut-out glyphs. This has been done by both the
Digital Libraries Team of the Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Center (#dudczak2014)
(open-source). The latter group has reportedhttp://emop.tamu.edu/final-report that they were able to
reach a character accuracy of about 86% on the ECCO document
collectionEighteenth Century Collections Online, http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/ and 68% on the EEBO
collection. Their OCR results suffer badly from scans of binarized
microfilm images containing a lot of noise.
The Kallimachos project at Würzburg
University did have success with Franken+ to reach character accuracies over 90%
for an incunable printing (#kirchner2016), but this method again
relies on creating diplomatic transcriptions from scratch for each individual
font. Ul-Hasan, Bukhari, and Dengel (2016) proposed a method to circumvent
ground truth production by first training Tesseract on a historically
reconstructed font (#ulhasan2016). They then applied the resulting
model to a specific book and used the recognized text as pseudo-ground truth to
train OCRopus. The newly recognized text was again used as pseudo-ground truth
for another round of OCRopus training, and after a few iterations they also
achieved character accuracies above 93%, but their method shifts the effort to
the manual (re)construction of the printed font. Training OCRopus with erroneous
OCR recognition as pseudo-ground truth was also tried as one of several methods
to improve OCR quality in Springmann, Fink, and Schulz (#springmann2016b) but was always found to yield inferior results
compared to training on even a small amount of real ground truth at the order of
100 to 200 printed lines which consistently lead to character accuracies above
95%.
A completely different approach was taken with the new Ocular OCR engine by
Berg-Kirkpatrick, Durrett, and Klein (2013) and Berg-Kirkpatrick and Klein
(2014) which is able to convert printed to electronic text in a completely
unsupervised manner (i.e., no ground truth is needed) employing a language,
typesetting, inking, and noise model (#bergkirkpatrick2013)
(#bergkirkpatrick2014). This may be a viable alternative for
training individual models with low manual effort, but it seems to be very
resource-intensive and slow (transcribing 30 lines of text in 2.4 min) (#bergkirkpatrick2014). Its results are better than (untrained)
Tesseract and ABBYY, but it remains to be shown that they can consistently reach
character accuracies higher than 90%.
In summary, while there are other approaches to train individual OCR models for
the recognition of historical documents, so far none have reported results as
good as OCRopus when trained on real data (consistently over 94% character
accuracy), nor has it been shown that one could construct generalized models
applicable to a variety of books with reasonable results (above 90% character
accuracy).
3. Diachronic Corpora and RIDGES
Our method is evaluated using a diachronic corpus because diachronic
corpora with their extremely high variability are a good test case for the
training and application of our OCR models. Many historical corpora are
basically synchronic, covering a given linguistic period.
Basically, even the so-called synchronic corpora for older language stages
are often diachronic, covering a long period of time; examples are the
reference corpora in the DeutschDiachronDigital project, such as the
Referenzkorpus Altdeutsch (http://www.deutschdiachrondigital.de/home/) or the Old and Middle
English Corpora listed at http://users.ox.ac.uk/~stuart/english/med/corp.htm In
addition to these synchronic corpora, there is a small number of diachronic
corpora built specifically to do research on change phenomena. Over and above
the variation that comes through different dialects, traditions, text types,
etc. which is present in any corpus, there is variation that is caused by
linguistic and extralinguistic change. The construction of diachronic corpora is
subject to all the problems and decisions faced in the construction of
synchronic historical corpora, such as corpus design decisions in a situation
where many text types or dialects are simply not available, issues of choosing
the original text (e.g. manuscript/print or edition), and
questions of tokenization, normalization, or annotation, etc. (see (#rissanen1989)
(#ludeling2004)
(#rissanen2008)
(#archer2015)
(#gippert2015) among many others). Linguistic changes that make
the construction of diachronic corpora more difficult are, among many others,
changes in spelling, changes in word formation, or changes in syntax such as
changes in word order.
Extralinguistic changes that might prove problematic include the change of medium
(manuscript, print), but also changes within a medium such as different scripts,
changing conventions with respect to layout, abbreviations, inclusion of images,
the development of technical equipment (i.e. the printing press) or paper
quality as well as the development of science with its methods and conventions,
the foundation of universities and the addition of new areas of research (#eisenstein1979)
(#weel2011)
(#klein1999)
Most existing high-quality historical (synchronic and diachronic) corpora are
transcribed, collated, and corrected manually, sometimes by (offshore)
double-keying transcription. If OCRed text is available for historical prints at
all, the quality is typically too low for linguistic studies (#strange2014)
(#piotrowski2012).
Manual transcription is time-consuming and expensive and it requires well-trained
transcribers. It would therefore be very useful for historical studies to have
accesss to high quality OCR. While our focus here is on linguistic
research questions it is obvious and has been argued many times (see e.g.,
the DFG Practical Guidelines on Digitisation [02/13], p. 29; http://www.dfg.de/formulare/12_151/) that the better the OCR
quality, the more useful the resulting text is for any kind of research. The
re-usability of corpora has been an issue in many recent endeavours (cf.
(#ludeling2008)
(#geyken2015), among many others) but cannot be discussed
here. The RIDGES corpus which we use in this article to test our
methods is being constructed for research on the development of the scientific
register in German (similar corpora are available for English, see e.g. the
corpora constructed by the Varieng group
in Helsinki). It contains herbal texts from between the earliest printings to
about 1900. Herbal texts are chosen because they are available throughout the
history of German (see e.g. (#riecke2004)
(#gloning2007)) and are among the earliest scientific texts that
are available in a vernacular language in Europe. These texts are often
compilations or loose translations or transmissions from Latin herbal compendia
(transmitting authoritative texts from famous physicians such as Dioscorides,
Galen, or Avicenna) and can be viewed as predecessors of scientific and popular
texts about plants and illnesses (#habermann2003)
(#klein2011)
The current version of RIDGES (5.0)
http://korpling.german.hu-berlin.de/ridges/index_en.html. The
corpus is freely available under the CC-BY license. It can be downloaded in
several formats as well as queried through the ANNIS search tool (#krause2016). The corpus is still growing. Here we focus only
on the first step in corpus compilation. More on meta-data, annotation, and
analysis can be found in (#odebrecht2017)
contains excerpts (about 30 pages each) from 33 different books roughly spaced
between 1487 and 1914. The originals are very different from each other in
appearance. The earliest texts are mostly collections of herbal
monographs, that is descriptions of a given herb with respect to
its properties according to the theory of humoral pathology, its medical
indications, and ways of preparation for treatment. Starting in the 16th
century, we increasingly find botanical facts. Later texts show greater variety.
Some are clearly botanical or medical, others are more in the realm of popular
science. Because RIDGES is used for register studies, it is necessary to analyse
and annotate many different properties (lexical, morphological, syntactic,
structural, etc.) of each text (#biber2009). The corpus is
consequently stored in a multilayer architecture; annotation layers can be added
at any time (#krause2016). The texts are transcribed
diplomatically, normalized on several layers, and annotated deeply (some of the
texts contain as many as 53 annotation layers).
For our present purpose, the most important layer is the diplomatic transcription
which serves as training material (ground truth) for the OCR engine
(see below), and we want to briefly explain the decisions we took to prepare the
diplomatic layer. For all the texts in RIDGES, scans are available from
libraries (mostly from Bavarian State Library) or from other sources such as Google Books. Early texts are
transcribed manually by students and collated and corrected by other students
and researchers; for later texts it is sometimes faster to correct existing OCR
results available from library digitization programs or Google Books. The
transcription is highly diplomatic - differences between letter forms (like
ſ and s) are preserved as well as abbreviation
signs (e.g. vñ for modern German und,
modoꝝ for modorum with Latin abbreviation
ꝝ), or other special characters. Words broken up at a line
break are also broken up in the transcription. Layout information (line breaks,
page breaks, etc.), information about typefaces (Antiqua, broken fonts), and
rendering (colors, spaced type, etc.) are provided in the annotation.
4. Training the OCR engine on historical printings
Our training procedure is based on the OCRopus software which was the first OCR
engine with a recognition algorithm based on recurrent neural nets
(RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) (#hochreiter1997)Tesseract in its upcoming version 4 also uses long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks, but its training procedure is quite resource
intensive and there is not yet any documentation available on how to train a
recognition model on real printed images. The LSTM architecture
overcomes the problem of earlier neural networks to forget previously learned
information and has proven to be very successful in pattern recognition tasks
such as handwriting recognition (#graves2009), even in the context
of medieval manuscripts ((#fischer2009) got a word accuracy of 93%
on isolated words). Models trained with lots of computer fonts led to excellent
recognition results for 19th and 20th century printings of Antiqua and Fraktur
(blackletter) typefaces with accuracies above 98.5% (#breuel2013).
As mentioned in the introduction, for earlier printings it is necessary to train
on real data. Images of printed lines have to be matched with their
corresponding transcriptions (see Figure 2). Unicode character codes for unusual
historical characters are available due to the efforts of the Medieval Unicode Font
Initiative.
The segmentation of the image of a printed page into single text lines is part of
a preprocessing step that also involves other functions such as deskewing,
border cropping, converting colored page images into binary or grayscale, and
some denoising. While OCRopus has its own routines for doing that, they are
rather basic and we used the open source program ScanTailor for producing clean
TIF-images of text regions that were subsequently cut into text lines by the
OCRopus subprogram ocropus-gpageseg.

Pairs of line images and their associated transcriptions needed for
training
During training, the OCR engine accesses these image-transcription pairs randomly
and learns to associate the inputs (vertical stripes of pixel values) to outputs
(characters). Because the line image gets divided into many vertical slices each
one pixel wide, there is no need to segment the line further into single glyphs
as is usually done by traditional OCR. Instead, the engine learns to associate
series of slices corresponding to single glyphs (including ligatures, digraphs,
etc., which are not easily segmented from neighboring glyphs) to characters or
even character groups automatically (see Figure 3). The cumbersome
reconstruction of fonts by cutting out images of the complete glyph repertoire
necessary for the training of Tesseract is thus completely avoided.

The training process in action: The neural network is presented with a
printed text line together with its transcription (uppermost panel). The
pixel coordinates at the x axis correspond to the vertical slices mentioned
in the text. Groups of sequential slices corresponding to a glyph are
learned automatically and labelled with the corresponding character from the
transcription. The two black panels show the network response to the feeding
of the line: the vertical axis represents the type case of the printer and
enumerates single characters (about 200), while the horizontal axis again is
the pixel width of the line. At each horizontal position, the number of the
output character is highlighted. The next panel shows the confidence by
which the network recognized the glyphs on a scale from 0 to 1. Blue
rectangles correspond to characters, green rectangles to inter-word spaces.
The last panel gives the prediction error over training history (over 23,000
lines have been seen at this point).
More detailed explanations of the inner workings of neural net training are given
in (#breuel2013), and a detailed tutorial on how to train models
from the user perspective is available in (#springmann2015).
Special recommendations for training models for incunable printings are given in
(#springmann2016a)
http://www.cis.lmu.de/ocrworkshop Springmann, Fink, and
Schulz (2016) show that a training set of just 100–200 randomly selected lines
with their transcription often results in a model that is almost as good in its
performance as more extensive training sets. In this study we used all the
available material (i.e. the ca. 30 transcribed pages for each book) and split
it into 90% for training and 10% for testing (#springmann2016b).
Every 1,000 learning steps (one step consists in seeing one image-transcription
pair) an OCR model is saved to disk, and after having seen each pair about 30
times the training process is stopped. The series of models is then evaluated on
the test set which has never been seen in training. Evaluation is done by a
line-wise comparison of the string of symbols representing the ground truth and
the OCR result, and the minimal edit (Levenshtein) distance between
these two symbol strings is the number of character errors for this line.
Complete error statistics are available from the OCRopus command
ocropus-errs. The model with the least error on this test when
comparing OCR result and ground truth is then selected as the best one
representing the training effort for this book. An example of the resulting OCR
text together with the corresponding page image is shown in Figure 4.

The resulting character and word accuracies for models trained on each book have
been evaluated on unseen test pages and are shown in Figure 5. To get an idea of
the variance of the measurement values we also indicated upper and lower limits
of a 95% confidence interval for character accuracies calculated from the
assumption that OCR recognition can be treated as a Bernoulli experiment with
the measured accuracy as the probability for correct recognition. For each book,
the individual model is able to recognize printed characters with an accuracy of
over 94%, sometimes even reaching 99%.
Word accuracies are also given, as they are important for search and indexing
purposes (#tanner2009). We have to keep in mind, though, that
early printings show a high variety of spellings and a high word accuracy does
not necessarily mean that we find every instance of a correctly recognized word
by searching for its modern equivalent. Evaluations of word accuracies were done
with the UNLV/ISRI Analytic Tools for OCR Evaluation (#nartker2005) Compared to character accuracies,
the word accuracies show a much wider variance, ranging from 76% to 97%. Except
for two instances (1675-D and 1687-D), however, all models have word accuracies
over 85%, twelve models over 90%, and five even over 95%, resulting in a mean
word accuracy of 91%. This is in stark contrast to the newspaper projects
reported in Tanner, Muñoz, and Ros (2009) with a mean word accuracy of 78% for
the 19th Century Newspaper Project and 65% for the Burney Collection (17th and
18th century newspapers) and illustrates the progress in recognition that has
become possible through Neural Network-based OCR models (#tanner2009).
The wider variance for word accuracies can be explained by the statistics of
single character errors. Assuming that we had 600 characters with 30 errors (95%
character accuracy), and that the 600 characters consist of 100 words, the 30
character errors could be contained in just 5 words or in 30 words with
resulting word accuracies ranging from 95% down to 70%. In the latter case,
erroneous words just contain a single character error and a better model with
half of the errors would therefore upgrade character accuracy from 95% to 97.5%,
but word accuracy would get a much higher boost from 70% to 85%.
The most striking result reported in Figure 5 is the lack of any correlation
between OCR accuracy and printing age. Models for even the earliest printings in
our corpus show top performance when the printings were well–preserved and good
scans were available.
These results have been achieved just by recognizing glyph shapes, without
employing any language model, lexicon, or postcorrection. This shows that OCR
quality does not deteriorate with earlier printing dates but instead depends on
the quality of the printings in its currently preserved state and the scans.
Lower accuracies point to instrinsic problems on book pages such as manual
annotation, speckles, or low resolution (about 150 dpi), especially when
downloaded from Google Books. Often a higher resolution of the same book was
available from the Bavarian State Library (BSB).E.g., a retraining on the
BSB scan of the same exemplar of Bodenstein's 1557 book increased the
accuracy from 95% to 99%. Given good printings in well–preserved
states, 300 dpi color or gray–scale scans, and an accurate preprocessing of page
images into single text lines (see the discussion in Section 7), it is possible
to reach character accuracies above 98% in all periods of modern printing. The
fact that commercial OCR applications yield increasingly worse results the older
the printing just reflects that fact that earlier printings are increasingly
different from the fonts the OCR engine has been trained on.

Character accuracies (blue columns) with 95% confidence intervals and word
accuracies (red columns) for models trained on the individual books given in
Table 1.
While the above results are very promising, they could only be reached by
training an individual model on each book. Using RIDGES, we are in the favorable
situation that the necessary ground truth needed for training is available. In
general, however, no such transcriptions will exist and this may still prevent
the application of OCR to large volumes of scans of historical books in an
automatic manner. It is therefore of interest to see how well the existing
models generalize to unseen books. To test how the individual models perform on
the other books of our selection, we applied each model to each book. The
resulting accuracies from this experiment are shown in Figure 6. The rows
represent the books, whereas columns designate the models.
As expected, the best result for each book is provided by its own model. This is
mostly true for the models as well, but in one case (1675-C) the trained model
performs better on other books with a similar font (1764-E and 1774-U, although
not as well as these books' models) than on its own book. The bad performance of
1675-C is due to the grayscale images lacking in contrast (see Figure 1). More
interesting is the question whether individual models give satisfactory results
on any other book. The model for 1675-C is an exception with accuracies over 90%
for books printed between 1609 and 1828. If accuracies above 90% are acceptable,
models trained on printings from the 17th century seem to be somewhat applicable
to printings from the 17th and 18th century, whereas for later, and especially
earlier printings, single models do not generalize well. In the next section, we
will therefore explore whether mixed models trained on several books will better
generalize to unseen books and offer a way to overcome the typography
barrier.

Cross evaluation of each model (column) on each book (row). Character
accuracies are color coded in the ranges greater than 95% (green), between
90 and 95% (yellow) and below 90% (gray).


6. Construction of mixed models
We trained two mixed models on a breakdown of our corpus into two parts by
choosing every other book as part 1 and the rest as part 2 (Figure 7). Each part
covers about 400 years of printing history so that we can test how well a mixed
model trained from a sample of books over a wide range of printing dates
generalizes to other unseen books dating from the same period.
The result of applying each of the two mixed models to the books from the other
subset is shown in Figure 7 (yellows columns) together with the accuracies of
individual models (blue columns). The results are given in terms of both
character accuracy (upper panel) and word accuracy (lower panel).
As may be expected, mixed models give a lower accuracy compared to individual
models (with the exception of 1774-U), because mixed models have not been
trained on books of the other part to which they have been applied. But except
for the two earliest printings and in contrast to Figure 6, both mixed models
now consistently reach over 90% character accuracy on books which did not
contribute to the training pool. In one case (1774-U) the mixed model shows a
slightly better performance than the individual model. This book is similar
enough in its typography to the books of the other part on which the mixed model
has been trained, so that recognition is improved. The incunable printing of
1487 gets the worst recognition from the mixed model because its typography is
unlike any other book in the corpus.
Comparing the difference in character and word accuracies, we see the effect that
the improved character accuracies that are obtained from going from a mixed
model to an individual model also improve the word accuracies, but by a larger
absolute margin (roughly, halving the character errors also halves the word
errors; see Table 2).

Accuracies of OCR results for individual models (blue) and for a mixed
model trained on the other part of the corpus (yellow).
The remaining OCR errors in both the mixed and individual model recognition
consist in equal numbers of substitution errors (one character gets confused
with another, often similar looking character, such as e
and c) and deletion or insertion errors (characters are
either not recognized at all or spurious characters are inserted where none were
printed). By far the most frequent deleted or inserted character is the blank,
which when inserted leads to broken-up words into two or more fragments, or if
deleted, leads to merged words where two or more printed words are recognized as
a single word. This again underscores the necessity to train a recognition model
on real printings, as a proper word distance model can be learned only in this
way, and even then the peculiarities of early-modern printing with its emphasis
on justified printing lines lead to relatively frequent errors involving the
non-character of blanks.
The training of mixed models does therefore seem to be a way to overcome the
typography barrier and it can provide models which generalize well over a wide
range of books. The resulting OCR text can at least be taken as a first
approximation and better models can be trained from an error corrected version
of its recognized text. The same conclusion has been reached in a study on
twelve Latin books printed from 1471 to 1686 in Antiqua fonts in Springmann,
Fink, and Schulz (2016), where a method is given to construct better individual
models with minimal manual effort starting from a mixed model (#springmann2016b).
7. Discussion
For the practical purpose of historical corpus construction, it is very
encouraging to see that we can train OCR models that work very well for even the
oldest printings. However, this success comes at the price of necessary training
for each new font. The peculiarities of early typesetting requires that we train
on real data and we must therefore manually prepare the ground truth for a
couple of pages. The resulting trained model will be applicable to all works
printed with the same font, which for early printings means the same font of the
same typographer's office which may have been used for a whole series of works.
The possibility to train mixed models covering a range of historical fonts and
periods is a big step forward to convert historical printings to electronic text
without having to train an individual model for each text. In the absence of
ground truth, one can start with the output of a mixed model and only correct it
if needed, so that manual transcription is reduced to a minimum of about 100 to
200 text lines (#springmann2016b).
We want to stress that the usefulness of OCR results for research purposes
depends not only on recognition quality of perfectly segmented text lines, but
also on preprocessing (page segmentation, binarization etc.) and postprocessing
steps (error correction, normalization, annotation) which we will discuss in
turn.
Because text recognition happens on single printed lines, we need to segment
printed pages into those lines. This is not a trivial task, as many historical
printings abound with decorative initials, floral decorations, marginal
annotations (printed and manual), and image drawings (see Figure 1). Anything
that goes wrong at this preprocessing stage will lead to bad recognition results
later. Because the preprocessing routines of the OCR engines are often not able
to solve this difficult task in a satisfactory automatic manner there is a need
for specific tools which could at least assist a human to semi-automatically
segment the page images. ScanTailor is too restricted when the layout becomes
too involved with text columns, headings spanning the columns, margins,
footnotes, etc. To fill this gap, a new open source tool has been made available
(LAREX) that allows the user to quickly interact with the layout, define some
general parameters and have a complete document segmented automatically,
including the reading order (#reul2017b). Errors occuring in this
automatic process can afterwards be amended manually. In a case study treating
an incunable printing consisting of almost 800 pages, the complete document
could be segmented into text zones by an experienced user in less than six hours
(#reul2017a)
On the postprocessing side, we first have to deal with the accuracy of the OCR
result. Whether the uncorrected OCR output is sufficient for research or not
depends on the specific research interests of a scholar. 95% character accuracy
(or 90% word accuracy) may be enough for searching within a work or a corpus,
especially if the search is spelling tolerant and if the results are
simultaneously highlighted in the scan. Getting a high percentage of possible
hits (high recall) is more important than getting a low number of
false hits (high precision), because false hits can easily be
discarded by looking at the scan. Any true hit will provide the researcher with
a piece of evidence he is looking for. For other interests a higher accuracy
might be needed and error correction will be necessary. The efficiency of
correction will be greatly helped by a tool that presents whole series of
statistically induced errors which the user can inspect, select, and correct in
a single step. The more common errors can then be corrected with little effort,
boosting accuracy and leaving only rare errors for which one still would need to
go over the complete text if needed. Such a postcorrection method enabling batch
correction of common errors has been developed at the Center for Information and
Language Processing of LMU under the name of PoCoTo and is available
under an open-source licence (#vobl2014). Furthermore, the tool is
able to distinguish between historical spellings and real OCR errors and offers
only the latter category for correction. It can import OCR results from ABBYY
Finereader (XML), Tesseract (hOCR), and OCRopus (hOCR) and export the corrected
text as pure text, XML, hOCR, or TEI.
But even if we had 100% correct transcriptions from corrected OCR recognition, we
would still be hampered by the fact that there is no standardized spelling for
historical texts which results in a high degree of variation (the same word can
be spelled in several different ways by the same author in the same text).
Often, but certainly not always, there is an etymologically related modern word.
Depending on the research question, there might be different ways of dealing
with meaning change or etymological replacement. Searching then becomes
problematic as searches are usually done by entering search terms in modern
spelling. One needs to make sure that all tokens with their various historical
spellings are found. How this can best be achieved with a combination of modern
and historical lexica and a set of historical patterns by which modern and
historical wordforms may get connected has been described by Gotscharek et al.
(#gotscharek2011)
The current paper only considers the production of OCR recognized text, but for
corpus construction one would also like to have methods for automatic
normalization of historical texts, so that the expansion of modern wordforms to
multiple possible historical wordforms becomes unnecessary, and which would also
allow further treatment of corpus texts such as part-of-speech tagging and
lemmatization. Work in this direction has been done by Pilz et al. (#pilz2008),
Bollmann, Petran, and Dipper (#bollmann2011). The RIDGES corpus contains a special annotation
layer with a manually normalized token for each historical token. Normalized
layers (which in multi-layer architectures can be provided in addition to the
diplomatic layers) allow searches across different spellings (stemming from
different authors and times) and can be used as input for automatic tools.
Odebrecht et al. (in press) illustrate this using several test cases (#odebrecht2017). Weiß and Schnelle (2016) sketch how the
normalized layer of RIDGES can be used for automatic parsing (#wei)
Finally, one has too keep in mind that residual recognition errors present in any
OCR corpus may exert a bias on research (see (#traub2015)), so
that at least an indication of OCR quality in the absence of any ground truth
would be highly desirable to give researchers an idea of what quality they are
dealing with. Some work in this direction is reported in Springmann, Fink, and
Schulz (#springmann2016b).
To summarize, currently the main obstacles for a machine-assisted construction of
historical corpora are the problems of automatic segmentation of page images
into text and non-text zones, the recognition of historical fonts, and the
postprocessing problems of error correction and normalization. The better we
solve the recognition problem by means of trained historical OCR and mixed
models, the more prominent the preprocessing (segmentation) and postprocessing
(error correction, normalization) problems will become.
8. Summary and Conclusion
We have shown that the new trainable OCR method based upon LSTM RNNs can provide
high recognition accuracies (character accuracies from 95% to over 99%, word
accuracies from 76% to 97%) for images of early printings regardless of their
age, provided good scans are available. An OCR model trained on the diplomatic
transcription of some pages can be used for the recognition of the rest of the
book and leads to electronic text whose quality may already be sufficient for
many research questions. The availability of generalized models trained on a
mixture of fonts would further ease the use of OCR on historical documents, as
the output of these mixed models can be taken as a first approximation to a true
representation of the text and may be corrected (and better models trained on
it) if needed. The models trained on RIDGES have been used to recognize whole
books and thus led to an expanded, if somewhat inaccurate, electronic corpus.
Both this corpus (named RIDGES-OCR) and the above mentioned mixed models are
available under CC-BY.
https://www.linguistik.hu-berlin.de/en/institut-en/professuren-en/korpuslinguistik/research/ridges-projekt/ocr?set_language=en
As more and more diplomatically transcribed texts (either manually transcribed
or recognised by OCR methods) become available, their usability as a corpus for
research purposes will depend on automatic means to normalize historical
spelling (even in the presence of OCR errors) enabling both search and indexing
as well as further analysis such as part-of-speech tagging and
lemmatization.It would be very beneficial if a consortium of libraries
would set up a central repository for trained models that would otherwise
end up on the hard disks of individual users and not be available for others
who would unnecessarily need to train the same model again. Even better, the
complete training procedure could be made available via a web interface
which allows the user to transcribe some pages as ground truth, train a
model (possibly through several refinement steps as explained above), and at
the end provide the user with the recognized text in some marked-up format
as well as adding the model and ground truth to the repository. That way
both the individual user and the community at large would benefit from an
ever-increasing amount of ground truth, corresponding image data and trained
models.
