word applesauce

1 INTRODUCTION
One of the goals of the literary critic is to analyze language and its embedded
complexity. For example, when literary critics examine a poem’s form, they
consider many characteristics of the words it contains, including the
similarities and differences in orthography, sound, the visible pattern it
produces, rhythmic structure, and countless others. Nearly all of this
information is available through visual inspection of the poem and contained in
what may already be our greatest visualization technique — the written word.
However, this same inspection carries with it the biases introduced by the
semantic meanings of the words themselves: it is difficult to pay attention to
the structural parts of the word “apple” without imagining the fruit it
represents.
One possible method of aiding in the process of literary criticism is to provide
an alternate representation (#simon1988) of the words contained
within the text to help separate the meaning from the structure, or to provide a
different vantage point with which to examine the work. By providing this
alternate view, structural aspects of the poem that may be difficult to
recognize when obfuscated by the meaning of the words themselves may be easier
to analyze and observe. We caution that this understanding will likely not be
valuable unless a connection can be bridged between the alternate representation
and the original piece of literature, and we stress that this approach is to be
considered an augmentation to existing practices. The goal of the research
presented in this paper is to provide an information visualization that provides
alternate representations of literature that will allow the critic to recover
the original work for analogic purposes.
There have been a variety of examples in the digital humanities and information
visualization disciplines that provide alternate representations of language,
such as Word Clouds (#viegas2008), but the authors are not aware of any examples
that have as a priority the ability to discern the text itself from the
visualization. Instead, these examples provide a means of examining text with
prior knowledge of the contents therein. Nonetheless, it is an open question
whether this change in representation would prove useful to the trained literary
critic.
In this paper, we present a design study of an information visualization that is
a recoverable representation of language. Specifically, we present the design of
a visualization we have named Language DNA (L-DNA) that visually encodes any
symbol system, in our case the letters and phonemes of words in the English
language, and a qualitative evaluation with several literary critics and
designers to investigate the need and use of such a visualization.
2 RELATED WORK
Our study is an examination of how to visualize language in ways that can build
ontologies of words based on the needs of the literary critic. Much work has
been done in the area of text visualization but none have yet approached a level
that can produce whole language interactions. Our work builds on previous text
visualization techniques while expanding on the scope of information that can be
shown in our system, Language DNA.

2.1 Text Visualization
Many previous text visualizations focused on some form of text. For instance
there are visualizations of documents (#collins2009a)
(#paley2002)
(#hetzler1998)
(#vanham2009)
(#wattenberg2008). There are also visualizations for grouping
and clustering documents (#collins2009b)
(#wise1995). However, they do not approach whole language
visualization. Most approaches to text visualization whether coming from the
Information Visualization (InfoVis) community or the digital humanities, are
often aesthetically pleasing, but have not been demonstrated to have utility
for literary criticism or linguistics. This limitation can be seen in text
visualization projects such as tag clouds (#lee2010)
(#viegas2008)
(#viegas2009)
(#vanham2009), topic modeling
(#gardiner2010)
(#gretarsson2011)
, and text document comparison (#collins2009a)
(#lin1992)
(#smalheiser2009)
(#wise1995). There are text visualization projects that fall
into the category of linguistics that have had some success. (#rohrdantz2012) provide a visual analysis of suffixes in
English, and the Google N-Gram https://books.google.com/ngrams
viewer has given access to historical usage data previously unattainable.

2.2 Visualizing Language in the Digital Humanities
Within the domain of digital humanities, there are three main streams of
visualization that tend to pervade the literature. All three types are based
in text analysis but approach the problem from different directions. The
first is the GIS type tools for organizing spatial data in the humanities
(#jessop2006)
(#jessop2008)
(#wood1992), specific examples of this type of work include
Bingenheimer et al.’s visualization of the biographies of Buddhist monks
(#bingenheimer2009), in which there are examples of multiple types of
quantitative and qualitative data presented in a GIS format.
The second category involves tools used to augment reading, text analysis
tools that highlight relationships in texts, often with visualizations. This
category includes work such as Clement’s distant reading of Gertrude Stein
(#clement2008), and Wattenberg et al.’s work on using tree
visualizations for visual concordances (#wattenberg2008).
Projects such as TAPoR (#tapor2015) also provide data mining
tools for literary and textual analyses. The aim of these projects is to
allow for interesting portions of large texts to be marked up and visualized
for comparison.
The third category of research is the straight visualization projects which
are of two types: The first are the projects that use toolkits such as
Voyant tools (#voyant2015) to accomplish their research task
and the second are the projects that create bespoke visualizations specific
to their research problem. The second type of these includes Moretti’s work
on visualizing interactions and character movements in literature (#moretti2005), Bingerheimer et al.’s social network
visualization from TEI data, which uses text encoded data to produce
networked relationships among textual elements (#bingenheimer2006), and Gould’s use of network tools for
historical data analysis (#gould2003). This can also be seen
in the TextArc project, which uses radial graphs to show contents and
relationships between words in texts (#paley2002), and Writing
without Words (#posavec2015), Posavec’s beautiful graphs of
sentence structures and themes in Kerouac’s “On the Road”. Perhaps the most
exciting and cognate study is Alexander’s work on the Oxford Historical
Thesaurus and mapping sonic relationships in language over time (#alexander2012). Also, we find a movement to projects that use
art to approach these problems, highlighting that aesthetics may be itself a
critical tool. Installations such as TextRain (#textrain2015),
an interactive art piece where gallery goers interact with falling text, and
Word Collider (#wordcollider2015), an artistic project modeled
after pictures from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, where parts of words when
smashed together produce effects like those seen in images from
particle accelerators.
The development of our technique was motivated by the fact that existing
visualizations and text analysis tools, while usually aesthetic pleasing,
cannot easily be used for the types of analyses expected or desirable for
literary criticism or linguistics. Our Language DNA is an attempt to build a
system that can handle multiple levels of information to display complex
structural and content-related relationships within texts.

3 MOTIVATION — A LITERARY CRITIC’S PERSPECTIVE
In his book Anatomy of Criticism, Northrop Frye asks
the question:
what if criticism is a science as well as an
art?
(#frye2000)
The development of the visualization technique presented here was driven
by this exact question. Our intention is to facilitate a different approach to
Frye’s domain-specific question about literary criticism: can we use
mathematical and visualization techniques to incorporate science into a literary
criticism? These questions have a long history in the humanities and were born
out of the general notion that arose in the renaissance when the likes of Locke,
Bacon, and Descartes defined a practice that separated and solidified science
from the humanities. The 20th century structuralists suggest that this position
is reconcilable, that all literature and language is systematic. This idea —
that language is systematic — is approachable via visualization.
The visualization algorithm we present can accommodate as much or as little
information that a critic could want, giving the possibility of visualizing as
little as a single letter, as much as entire corpora. If we are to imagine a
space where the literary critic or linguist can experiment using a
language-based mathematics, it must have these three characteristics:

3.1 Consistency and Reversibility
First, a visualization algorithm is needed to encode language such that we
can create a space that is both consistent and reversible. In mathematical
terms, this would be referred to as one-to-one and onto. The need for
consistency and reversibility arises from the requirement in the analysis
process of preserving the ability for human interpretation of the words. In
order for the visualization to be “readable” by a critic, each word must be
consistently mapped and that mapping must be reversible into the original
work. Most existing visualization techniques distort the original texts
without providing an avenue for reconstituting them. This is problematic
when studying things like poetics where the spatial component of the text is
integral to its meaning.
3.2 Infinite Plotting Space
Second, it is important that the algorithm uses a plotting space that is
infinite. Imagine that we were to approach the problem of metaphor. As an
example, in theory we do not know if the chain of meaning created by
metaphoric relations between words is finite. It stands to reason then, that
without an understanding of the full requirements of a system that an
infinite space is a safe decision. If we are to start to approach these
types of questions our lack of knowledge should not limit the size of
possibilities. Specifically, the critic must be able to analyze words and
literature that are perhaps not known to the visualization designer. With
our technique, we can encode anywhere from one letter to an entire language,
to the entire literatures of one language, and even multiple languages, in a
space where each point belongs to one individual piece of original
information. The infinite space means that in creating experiments
the literary critic is not limited to our present understanding of
language.
3.3 Layering
The third requirement is the need for the ability to layer symbols in order
to make comparisons. For instance, it should be possible to overlay a poem
within the context of the entire language or other poetry. The need for
layering arises from the analogic basis of most types of literary critical
and linguistic inquiries. This should extend to any types of symbols, as
comparisons are not always rooted in the Latin alphabet. Based on what we
recognize as the possible requirements of such a system, we designed our
Language DNA visualization with the three characteristics of consistency and
reversibility, infinite plotting space, and layering in mind.

4 DEFINING LANGUAGE DNA
An important property of our mapping is that the words be recoverable from the
visual space. Mathematically, this requires that the mapping be a bijection
(i.e., that words both map to a unique place in the visual space, and that each
point in the visual space maps back to a word). As an example of the technique
we introduce a mathematical translation of words to numbers that relies on the
lexicographical ordering of letters. This is essentially a mapping of
alphabetical order and is one of possibly infinite ways to group the data. We
have chosen this technique as a first demonstration because we are all familiar
with the way we order a dictionary, but we must stress that we can map the data
many different ways. We define the mapping 𝑔 so that each letter is
mapped to its position in the alphabet, as follows:
𝑔 ∶ 𝐴  →  ℤ

where 𝐴 is the set of alphabetical characters {𝑎, 𝑏 … ,
𝑧} and:
𝑔(𝑎) = 1, 𝑔(𝑏) = 2, … ,
𝑔(𝑧) = 26

Note that this mapping is currently written using base 10 numbers for the
integers (1 to 26, with an implied 0 for no character), but our mapping requires
a base 27 representation (or more generally base N+1, where N is the number of
characters in the language), which for convenience we will symbolically
represent as follows:
110 = 𝑎27 (i.e., 1
in base 10 is represented as ‘a’ in base 27)210 = 𝑏27 ...
2610 = 𝑧27

Thus, we can define our mapping of words to a one-dimensional number line as
follows:
𝑓: 𝑊 → (0,1)

where 𝑊 is the set of alphabetical words (e.g.,apple, dog,
the, etc.) such that for each 𝑤 𝜖 𝑊,
𝑤 = 𝑥1 𝑥2 ... x𝑛,
and:
𝑓 (𝑤) = 0.(𝑥1)𝑔(𝑥2) ...
𝑔(𝑥𝑛)

For example, for 𝑤 = “dog”, we have x1 = ‘d’, 𝑥2 = ‘o’,
𝑥3 = ‘g’, therefore:
𝑓 ("dog") = 0.𝑑𝑜𝑔

Note that this is a base 27 number, but could be converted to base 10:
0.𝑑𝑜𝑔27 = 4x27-1 + 15x27-2 + 7x27-3 = 0.169079910
All words in the English language visualized along a number line from 0 to
1, and the specific word dog (represented as a vertical line in red)
would appear 16.9% of the way in.
If we relax the restriction that each word needs to end (i.e., we allow words to
have an infinite sequence of letters), it becomes clear that 𝑓 is a bijection,
since every word generates a unique base 27 representation (one-to-one: the
property that if two words map to the same number, they must be the same word)
and each number between 0 and 1 can be converted to base 27 to recover the
sequence of letters (onto: the property that every number has a word that can
map onto it).

4.2 Using the 2D Visual Space
The mapping above describes how an arbitrary word can be mapped onto a number
line, which already allows the visual mapping of words onto an axis in 1D
space (similar to a lexicographical axis). Here, we describe a method,
inspired by Cantor’s Diagonalization to map an individual word onto 2D space
directly (and more generally onto n-dimensional space).
We can split the word in two by considering every other character, for
instance InFoViS would become IFVS and
noi. Thus, we can take the base 27 representation of the
mapped word and create two dimensions as follows:
𝑓2:𝑊  →  
(0,1)2 𝑓2(𝑤) = 𝑓2(𝑥1𝑥2 ...
𝑥2𝑛) = (𝑓(𝑥1𝑥3 ...
𝑥2𝑛-1) ,
(𝑓(𝑥2𝑥4 ... 𝑥2𝑛))

For example, if our word is applesauce (Fig. 3):

The entire English language can also be visualized in 2D (top-left).
The result is what appears as a grid of letter pairs, so that one can
zoom into words that begin with AP (top-right), and within that square,
words that begin with APPL (bottom).
𝑓2 ("applesauce") =
(0.𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑐,
0.𝑝𝑙𝑠𝑢𝑒)

which, in base 10 would be:
𝑓2 ("applesauce") =
(0.0592410,0.6100587)

This mapping can easily be extended to n-dimensions by taking every nth character in the base
27 representation of (𝑤). f2 is also clearly a bijection, because every word
can be split into alternating characters to generate two base 27
representations (one-to-one) and each pair of numbers between 0 and 1 can be
converted to base 27 to recover the two parts of the word, which can then be
reassembled (onto). Thus, every word in the English language can be mapped
onto a 2D space using f2,
and every 2D point can be mapped to a word, where a word is a
sequence of possibly infinite letters which may well not have associated
semantics. Note that this mapping does not account for things like homonyms,
but with a simple addition to the mapping we could easily differentiate
words for any number of their ontological characteristics.
4.3 A Note on Scale
Since whole natural languages are immense, it is important to discuss scale,
both of what is being visualized and the size of the resulting
visualization. We can base a visualization size calculation on the number of
words being visualized, and then determine the length of a 1D L-DNA
visualization that draws at a density of a single pixel for each word or
unit (it is important to remember that these calculations are for
orthography, they will change depending on the symbol system used). Two
measures are needed to accomplish this: the smallest and the largest
distance between two words. Since our algorithm already normalizes words in
1D to be between 0 and 1, we can assume that the difference between the
largest and smallest words is approximately 1.0 (with the words ‘a’ and
‘zygote’, this is already correct to 1 decimal place). In our analysis of
words from the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), the two closest words using
our algorithm are “abandoner” and “abandoning”, with the first seven letters
in common and the next being very close in the alphabet. The difference in
values from our algorithm for these two words is:
0.abandoning27 - 0.abandoner27 = 1.37 x 10-1110

Thus, to present a number line from 0 to 1 with numbers only 1.37×10-11 apart represented as different pixels would
require:
1.0 ÷ (1.37 x 10-11) = 73.1 billion
pixels

Note that in 2D, our algorithm fairs far better. This same pair of words
would be broken down into two pairs of coordinates:
(0.aadnn27, 0.bnoig27) and (0.aadnr27, 0.bnoe27)

which has at most four letters in common for each dimension and would require
only:
1.0 ÷ (0.aadnr27 -
0.aadnn27) = 1.0 ÷
(2.79x10-7) = 3.6 million pixels

To put this into perspective, a 1D visualization using our algorithm would
require the width of 38.1 million 1080p screens (1920 × 1080 pixels) placed
side-by-side, and a 2D visualization would require 6.2 million 1080p screens
arranged to form a rectangle.

5 ILLUSTRATING L-DNA
We start with three examples to demonstrate how L-DNA can be used to visualize
language. The first is a dictionary mapping for the English language, the second
is a view of multiple languages, and the third is a mapping of English phonemes
to illustrate the applicability of this approach to any set of symbols We
present only three simple possibilities here. It must be stressed that the
algorithm works for any symbol system or combination of symbols
systems..

5.1 Visualizing the Oxford English Dictionary
Fig. 4 shows all 370,624 words parsed with criteria that eliminate diacritics
and punctuation the Oxford English DictionaryWe have removed words
with diacritics and punctuation for simplicity of demonstration. The
algorithm is fully capable of handling these symbols with slight changes
to the function. rendered using the algorithm described above
(i.e., using the coordinates provided by f2. The result is a mapping that privileges the
first two letters of each word. That is, the x-axis can be read as an
alphabetical ordering of the first letters of words, and the y-axis can be
read as an alphabetical ordering of the second letters. This makes the top
left box AA, where you would find words such as Aardvark (note
that few words in English begin with two A’s, which is why this box is quite
sparse). This property is recursive, so that within each box, the third and
fourth letters are similarly privileged. For example, in the BA box,
there is an NA box, which has another NA box that contains the
word BANANA. This initial visualization shows how we can start to
understand where each word belongs within the 2d whole.

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED2) in 2D L-DNA
Because our algorithm privileges the spelling of words, this 2D
representation can be thought of as a form of 2D orthography (specifically
spelling rules). It is essentially a two-dimensional layout of alphabetical
order. This version of L-DNA reveals a bird’s-eye view of the
language that was not previously available to the literary critic, linguist,
or lexicographer; a critic could previously flip through a dictionary’s
pages or even a list of ordered English words, but this visualization
instead provides a new 2d spatial location for each word in this
dictionary.
5.2 The Multiple Language L-DNA View
Our second example compares multiple languages (English, French, German, and
Spanish). Fig. 5 shows these four languages each represented in 1D on the 0
to 1 number line using our algorithm, stacked for comparison. Visual
inspection reveals a similar sparseness in the ‘Q’ portion of the line for
all languages (i.e., few words in any of these languages begin with ‘Q’ and
any letter other than ‘U’), but additional sparseness in French, German, and
Spanish exists near the end of the alphabet (‘W’, ‘X’, ‘Y’).

Four languages in 1D stacked.
Fig. 6 also shows a side-by-side comparison of multiple languages in 2D, and
Fig. 7 overlays these four languages. Fig. 8 shows a close-up of the AL
region of the overlaid image. These side-by-side comparisons or overlays
allow for elementary analogic comparisons and can be expanded on with more
complex symbol encoding.

German and Spanish) in 2D L-DNA.

Close up of the subsection AL from Fig. 7
The above images were generated with the constraint that we only had access
to open source dictionaries (#dict2015) for languages other
than English (for which we have university-wide access to the OED). The
French (red) has 197,954 words, the English (blue) has 370,624 words, the
German (yellow) 425,501 words, and the Spanish (green) has 160,442
words.
5.3 English Phonemes in L-DNA
We chose the next example (Fig. 9), English phonemes, to demonstrate the
robustness of the technique to arbitrary symbolic representations of
language, and to create an analogue between the spellings of words and the
sounds of words. The mapping is organized in like sound units: vowels (e.g.,
AA, AE), semivowels (e.g., W,Y), stops (e.g.,
B,D,K), affricates (e.g., C, H, JH), fricatives (e.g., D,
SH, V), aspirates (e.g., HH), liquids (e.g., L, R),
and nasals (e.g., M, N, NG).

English Phonemes showing the Phoneme map of 370,624 words used from
the OED2 in 2D mapped by sound types (i.e. fricatives, stops,
etc.)
By organizing words into phonemes, some interesting observations can be made.
It appears clear that a portion of the phonemes are used primarily for the
first syllable and another distinct set is used primarily for the second
syllable. This can be observed through the densely populated top and right
columns, with the majority of the bottom-left part of the image containing
almost no English words. In addition, the top-right corner is mostly empty,
with the exception of a few very dense groups, representing the few phonemes
that are used for both the first and second syllables.
5.4 Poetry
The final example that we created was to insert a single poem into the space
that we created for English words and phonemes. This is a first step in
being able to use these spaces for analogic comparisons.
Some interesting patterns can be observed in the poem through visualizing it
in this manner. Firstly, in terms of orthography (Fig. 10) it becomes
possible to identify visual rhymes by cluster groups within the image. In
Fig. 11, this same phoneme visualization can be used to identify rhyming
patterns within a poem. As the phonemes group together it is possible to see
the types of sounds being repeated in the piece. Although this is easy to do
with a 16 line sonnet, it becomes much more difficult with a poem of any
significant length (e.g. Milton’s 10,000 + lines of verse in Paradise Lost) and this technique could help to
highlight macro-structures in poetry. Each diagram below is laid out
in two dimensions. This is a decision made during the encoding process and
can be n-dimensional based on the amount of information you wish to build
into the model. In this case we have chosen to show 2d representations for
simplicity. In Figure 10 we present what we label our alphabetical order
visualization where we represent words by their spellings. A visualization
of spelling alone may not lead to many insights, but is useful for simple
demonstrations. One area where this simple encoding could be used would be
to visually compare irregular spellings in Elizabethan drama. It would
provide quick visual access to the places in texts that differed and needed
an editor’s attention. The real power in this method comes from being able
to encode as many connections as desired. Work has been done in the digital
humanities and computer science in the last few years in word embedding
models and the consistency of our method could aid in the process of
detecting connections in texts by using vectors. In figure 11, we have
graphed phonemes in two dimensions. Any highlights that form vertical lines
are showing alliteration in the poem. An example is in the line from Donne’s
poem: Or like a thiefe, which till deaths doome be
read. The words deaths and doom line up vertically
to indicate alliteration in this particular encoding. If we wanted to
visualize rhymes we would simply encode the phonemes in reverse, privileging
the final phoneme and we would generate a similar graph. The n-dimensional
nature of the models allows for as much or as little data coding as needed,
including relations between words. The only limitations on the questions
that can be asked are the imagination of the analyst.

6.0 QUALITATIVE STUDY
We wanted to discuss this project with a cross-section of scholars to develop a
better understanding of how people understood L-DNA and whether or not they saw
potential uses for their research. Our goal was to gain insight into whether
this technique could inspire reactions and possibly spark interest in the
approach.

6.1.1 Participants
We intentionally sought participants from a variety of disciplines. We had 14
participants which included 1 visual artist, 3 literary critics, 1
rhetorician, 2 digital media critics, 1 database programmer, 1 business
analyst, 1 linguist, 2 interaction designers, 1 graphic designer, and 1
marketing specialist.
6.1.2 Procedure
Each participant took part in a thirty-minute interview and was first shown
L-DNA visualizations that we had intentionally left void of any legends or
axis labels, so that we could ask questions about their initial
interpretations. After showing the image in Fig. 4, the mapping of the OED
in two dimensions, we asked what they thought the image might be. We then
showed participants Fig. 7, four languages plotted in the same space, and
the interviewer gave a thorough explanation of the how the algorithm works
and what they were seeing. We took time to make sure they were comfortable
with the explanation and asked about their understanding. We then showed
them Fig. 8 to be able to further explain L-DNA and asked questions based on
the participants’ understanding. We also asked participants to complete a
post-interview questionnaire. Five questions were asked on a 5-point scale,
with an opportunity to provide free form answers:
Q1. Once explained to what extent is the visualization readable?
Q2. Do you think the white space has meaning?
Q3. Is the white space necessary?
Q4. Does representing languages by colour and words as points work well?
Q5. Does this spatial representation of language trigger new ideas?
The following three questions asked for free form answers only:
Q6. What are your initial interpretations of this visualization?
Q7. Can you imagine a more suitable or readable structure?
Q8. Please provide any criticism you have about this visualization.

7.0 RESULTS: SCALE-BASED QUESTIONS
The scale questions were answered as follows. For Q1, 6 out of 14 participants
told us the visualization was clear after the explanation (5 out of 5 on the
scale). FOR Q2, 9 out of 14 people said that the white space carried meaning to
them (5 out of 5) and 6 participants thought that this white space was
completely necessary. For Q4, 7 out of 14 people ranked a 5 out of 5 for the
visualization approach. 10 out of 14 participants said that the visualization
triggered new ideas for research (5 out of 5).
8.0 DISCUSSION: FREE-FORM QUESTIONS & INTERVIEWS
We have formulated our discussion around the free-form questions. Since our
participants were experts from a variety of fields and domains, the similarities
in answers in some cases are particularly interesting. In other places it is the
difference in answers that encourages us as researchers in terms of the
potential of L-DNA as a tool for approaching questions about language. In this
discussion we include the questions and a discussion of the general themes that
arose in the responses.

8.1 The Power of Representation
Interestingly, when shown the images without any labels, participants tended
to engage in metaphoric comparisons of what they were seeing. The omission
of a legend led each participant to find something that was cognitively
analogous to what they were being shown. For example, some responses were:

Is it zoomable? It has a DNA look or sort of ummm a matrix data flow
and I feel the urge to zoom it. It looks like I am really far away from
an unbound book, like how a book would be printed in sheets. It has that
type of aesthetic.
Well, it reminds me of DNA, like a screening test, it also looks like
a stamp, like someone has stamped something. It is a very tactile image,
I want to touch it.
It’s kind of like DNA. Like, uh, people show these images that
visualize DNA.

In response to this process, five out of nineteen (26%) of our participants
from varying backgrounds and fields, with no explanation of what they were
looking at, described Fig. 4 as appearing like DNA — the inspiration for the
name of our technique. This result also demonstrates the power of
representation held within L-DNA. Some of the responses received from
participants included references to stamped or fading paper, city grids,
abstract art, and digital clock faces. Because we were trying to create a
space that could handle an ontology of words, the DNA metaphor was highly
applicable based on the implications of describing parts of a long chain of
information.
8.2 White Space
In our interpretation of the study data, the questions about whitespace
(Q2-Q3) produced perhaps the most interesting results. It was during this
question that most of the participants began to hypothesize about the
space in the languages they use every day. Essentially the parts
of the visualization with an absence of marks inspired thought, because they
were in stark contrast to the actual dots drawn on the screen. This result
strongly indicates the analogic or comparative possibilities of this
technique — the literary critic can begin to understand what makes a word
English by recognizing what is not a word, or by investigating what words
poets or writers use that push the boundaries of language. This result is
encouraging for the domain-specific problems of literary criticism. One of
our requirements is a space for analogues and with the whitespace in this
simple mapping there is significant affect. The response of our participants
to the relationship between the whitespace and the space occupied by words
creates a relationship that gives insight into what sets of symbols we use
and which we do not use in our language. The sheer size of the whitespace in
comparison forces an understanding of how few of the possible arrangements
of letters we actually use. With further work we think it is possible to
show that more complex mappings will produce more complex analogues.
It was generally agreed upon that it was the relation of the empty space to
the marked space that created meaning and inspired insight into what the
visualizations were showing and what they could show.

the white space gives you a sort of ground against which it makes
sense... without it it might be even less evident

It was in the white, or the lack of spellings, that our participants saw the
potential for growth in the language, or commented on the enormous range of
letter combinations that we do not use in English. This is encouraging
because as we build “meaning” into these visualizations we expect the
response to be comparative, and we expect new interpretations will result
from these comparisons. Initial reasons were as follows:

Every letter can start a word, but does that mean that there’s
combinations of letters that don’t turn into words... you don’t have
words that start with trsz is that why there would be space... Maybe it
means that language is primitive, not as evolved as it could be.
I’m almost more interested in the dots in the white space... if
there's one I want to know what that is...the outliers are more
interesting.
What it does is show what the common letters are and common
overlaps.

For the researchers this result was surprising, but was explainable. Without
meaning being built into this version we were simply showing a
part of orthography (spelling) and, in this stripped down version of the
possibilities of the space, it was the comparison between what was empty and
what was marked that sparked the interest of our participants. This is the
exact response we were interested in and we anticipate with more complex
representations we will be able to see more complex analogies. Some of the
responses to this whitespace analogy are as follows:

I think the uniformity of the gaps are startling. It seems oddly
uniform and consistent. I think that potentially symbolically the gaps
can sort of be a formative quality of language and words will start to
fill in those gaps.
Well, I guess it kind of goes to show how constrained we are in
language, which shows how some things just are not possible with
spelling, which is kind of cool. There is so much blank space
particularly along certain lines, you get some sense that our alphabet
constrains us, which is why we have poets.

These responses were typical of all our participants and are very promising
for future work.
8.3 Reluctant Inspiration
When asked if the images they were seeing inspired any new thought processes,
they proved to be exciting to our participants and the answers that follow
show the breadth of their thinking:

You could map to any narrative, I would like to see this map out, A
Tale of Two Cities, it looks like a genetic footprint, like a genetic
phonetics, you get to see this formal genetic blueprint, it is more like
an autopsy of the text.
Yes, from a design and a fine art point of view. I think it is, again,
if you look at it as a design issue does it solve any problems, not yet,
but then again you are deconstructing something that already has that
problem solved so you are raising questions instead of solving problems
and you are raising interesting and meaningful questions.
Well, I mean my initial instinct is YES (emphasis given by the
participant), but I am not sure what that would be yet, I think it could
lead to a lot of productive conversations about how language operates or
the way someone creatively uses language.
These are important questions. Literature departments have always
performed as if they were in the shadows of the sciences and…[i]t seems
to me that this kind of work, although seemingly scientific, should be
the domain of literature department. It would be very important work for
us to do.

Interestingly the 1 person out of 14 who said no to being inspired (included
below) touched directly on the fact that the simplicity of our
representation of orthography was limiting but suggested in his negative
response that it could be interesting for literary criticism if we could
find a way to include meaning, which is fruitful ground for future work and
possible with the three criteria we laid out above for the development of
the technique:

I’m not sure it’s useful for literary theory or criticism because it
seems to explicitly set aside the question of meaning in favor of
orthography
Oh yea, um this is only for spellings well things get really
interesting when you get into phrases, rhetorical aspects of language
organization, the whole question of nuance which we like to think we are
studying as literary scholars. Once you get into these things and away
from mere spelling and into points that have meanings you can start to
clump together interpretation to different meanings.

8.4 Criticisms from Participants
Our participants were in some cases critical of the design of L-DNA. In
particular, the most common criticism centered on making the technique
interactive, which is a clear (and previously planned) next step in our
iterative design process. Another criticism was that the encoding we used
was arbitrary, and its meaning was not immediately clear:

The mechanism by which you map words to spatial locations, it’s kind
of arbitrary (maybe that’s not the right word). Mostly you see the first
two letters, and when you zoom in you’re seeing the space of subsequent
letters. I guess what this mapping is lacking is the Meaning of words,
or the semantics. They end up being distances from one another but … the
distance between related concepts, synonyms. I’m not necessarily saying
this is a bad visualization because of that. It just doesn’t encode the
meaning of words. Which is much harder. But, this is a legitimate way of
putting words in a consistent space.
The way that it is right now, that it’s static, it’s getting in the
way of itself. It demands explanation. It needs to be paired up with
something very practical, like reading a word or reading a sentence and
how that gets paired up in the system.

We see this interactivity as the next steps in developing an application for
these types of interactions and it is in that interactivity that the
objections to the arbitrariness of the design will be addressed. We
hypothesize that being able to investigate the space dynamically, and by
defining other symbol systems to encode, the literary critic will be able to
explore the types of meaning and associations being looked for by our
participants.

9 STUDY RESPONSE
From our qualitative study, the overwhelming result was the importance of the
white space in our visualizations to the entire group that was interviewed. This
reaction has influenced the direction of our future work and demonstrates that
this space can be used for the types of comparisons that we are interested in,
namely those that lead to interpretive possibilities. We recognize that we have
presented a simplified form, but the technique itself allows for infinite
complexity. Some of our participants talked about the need to include
information that gives meaning to relationships and that is the next step in
developing mappings that can solve the original problem of creating a space that
can be experimented in with language and literary theory. Our study confirmed
the idea that this technique has the potential to answer these much more complex
questions as they relate to the domain in question. The sheer breadth of answers
to our question in relation to inspiring new ideas is extremely promising and we
take it as a success in developing the type of space that can inspire
investigation.

9.1 Prioritizing Whitespace
In response to the discussion with participants about the interest in
whitespace and the lack of density in certain regions, we produced a density
and inverted density map to highlight the white spaces, shown in Fig. 12 and
Fig. 13.

This was in direct response to comments from our participants such as:

Yeah. But, one thing I was going to say… the UNIFORM inclusion of the
whitespace is interesting. But I wonder if there’s a better
representation of density and overlap.

In this iteration of our design, instead of rendering each word in the
language we instead cluster groups of words into the boxes representing
pairs of words (AA, AB, etc.), and render the box using
transparency that corresponds to the density of words therein. The inverted
version of this mapping highlights all of the non-English words, which were
clearly of interest to participants.
9.2 ygUDuh
We have discussed how the blank spaces are compelling and how the absence of
words in these spaces generally seems to intrigue people.
It is interesting to note that this space is and has been filled in many
interesting ways. For example, E. E. Cummings poem ygUDuh does not contain a
single English word, yet it can be read as English, where the words
take on the sonic characteristics of English when read aloud. For example,
the first few lines of the poem are:
ygUDuh

ydoan
yunnuhstan
That when read allowed becomes a phonetic map for a type of early 20th century urban slang exemplified by the
poem:
you gotta

you don’t
you understand
In Fig. 14 we have plotted ygUDuh overlaid on the OED grid. Note how these
non words exist largely on the edge of the word spaces and the
white spaces. This may be because, while they are not English words — hence
the white space proximity — they have similar vowel and consonant structures
to English words. By seeing these words overlaid on the whole language, we
can see a visual representation of Cummins’ craft, of the attempt to make
non English words that sound like English when read aloud. The fact that all
of the non-words are situated on the edges of heavily populated space tells
us that these arrangements of letters that we try to make into words when
reading the poem are closer to English words than we think, at least
in terms of spelling.

9.3 Instant Messaging
Another example where new types of words or at least English
communications are evolving is in instant messaging, text messaging, and
social media. It seems that for ease and speed, we can give up many letters
— chiefly the vowels — in words and still retain meaning. Fig. 15 shows MSN
words overlaid on the OED visualization. It is interesting to
note that many of the new words (marked with red dots), fall in the
spaces where very little or no words exist. This demonstrates that even in a
type of shorthand, like the one used in instant messaging (e.g., btw,
lol, ttyl, etc.) that many of the newly created words are
spelled with letter combinations that simply don’t exist in the language.
This is partially a result of the volume of acronyms used in instant
messaging but it becomes obvious by reading the image that many of
the words used fall on the top line of each row suggesting (such as with row
A, and row I) that many of these words and acronyms begin with those
letters. In this way our technique produces visuals that allow us to ask
further questions about the organization of our data.

9.4 Interaction
We have also begun to integrate interactive elements into our visualization,
some of which were planned prior to our qualitative study, and some of which
were inspired by our results. In particular, we have already created a
version of L-DNA which incorporates a brushing technique that presents the
words beneath the cursor, both when dragging across words and
when dragging across the whitespace. We have also created a version of the
density map (Section 9.1) that allows zooming into the recursive letter
pairs. For example, it is possible to click or tap on the BA square,
then the NA square, then another NA square to then see the
word BANANA as shown in the static image of figure 3.

10 CONCLUSION
In this paper we have introduced L-DNA and presented the findings of a
qualitative study of its design. In L-DNA, we have developed a mapping of symbol
systems to visual space, which we have demonstrated using language. Our
formulation has several properties that are valuable for the analysis of
language and are not available in some other common visualizations of language.
L-DNA has the following important features:

The L-DNA space is capable of handling any symbol string from a null
string to a string of infinite length. L-DNA can be used in 1, 2, or n
dimensions.
L-DNA space is infinite in that between any two points (words) in the
space there exists another word — though it may not have semantic
meaning.
The L-DNA space is one-to-one and onto (bijective). Every unique coding
maps to a unique position and, in reverse, words (or any original
information) can be recovered uniquely from the visual space.

We have mathematized language to make exploring and experimenting with language
easier, but the results of said experiments need to have the possibility of
being reversed out of the space to be able to assign meaning once again to the
language. We have also presented a qualitative study, which provided encouraging
results that indicate the power of the type of representation provided by L-DNA,
the benefit of the whitespace that it generates, and its possibilities to
provide inspiration (even if reluctantly), as well as some useful criticisms
that led to iterations in our design.
