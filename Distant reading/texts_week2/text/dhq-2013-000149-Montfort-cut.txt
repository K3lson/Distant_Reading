cut to fit the toolspun course includes a new gloss by the authors on the original JavaScript code. The code was originally published with some comments to assist those who might want to modify or re-use it; this version expands on those comments to explain more about the process ofdeveloping the generator and to reflect on the nature of comments and the glossing of code. This file, including comments both practical and reflective, is offered as one model for the criticism of literary works written in code.

A poetry generator which defines a space of language populated by a number of stanzas comparable to the number of fish in the sea, around 225 trillion



cut to fit the toolspun course is an edition of the JavaScript file that is the main component of our project Sea and Spar Between. It includes a slightly emended version of the original code along with a new gloss that we have written. The code was originally published with some comments to assist those who might want to modify or re-use it; this version expands on those comments to explain more about the process of developing the generator and to reflect on the nature of comments and the glossing of code. Since JavaScript allows for comments to be placed directly in the code, we have used this facility to join our discussion closely to the program. This file, including comments both practical and reflective, is offered as one model for the criticism of literary works written in code.

Read the glossed code file online, download the glossed code as a JavaScript file, or download a zipfile with every file that is needed to run Sea and Spar Between offline.
